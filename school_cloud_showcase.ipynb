    "### What is cloud data?\n",
    "- Cloud Data is stored on the internet so you can access it from anywhere.\n",
    "- Native Land Digital API cloud data gives us spatial information about indigenous lands.\n",
    "- An Imagery Layer is like a map layer of images that show Earth’s features and changes, helpful in studying environmental patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cloud Data is not stored in your computer or phone, rather, it is stored in remote servers\n",
    "Cloud data means that the data isn’t stored on your personal computer or phone, but instead, it’s stored on remote servers (essentially, other powerful computers) that you can access via the internet. Think of it like a virtual storage locker: instead of carrying all your books with you, you keep them in a locker that you can open from anywhere as long as you have a key (in this case, an internet connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Native Land Digital API\n",
    "**Native Land Digital API** is a resource developed to provide access to data on Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties worldwide. This API connects users to a wealth of information about Native lands and cultural heritage, gathered with the goal of increasing awareness and understanding of Indigenous territories and histories. By using the Native Land Digital API, educators, researchers, developers, and community members can easily access accurate maps and information about Indigenous Nations and their traditional territories. This tool allows users to explore how land and borders have been shaped by history, fostering a deeper appreciation for the diversity and resilience of Indigenous communities worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Imagery Layer\n",
    "An **imagery layer** is like a digital photograph of the Earth's surface taken from space. Satellites capture images of the Earth over time, which are then stored in layers that can be added to maps. Each layer might represent a different type of data, such as land cover (trees, water, cities), temperature, or weather patterns. By looking at these layers together, scientists can study changes and patterns on Earth over time. For example, an imagery layer from NASA might show how glaciers are shrinking or how forests are growing in certain areas."
