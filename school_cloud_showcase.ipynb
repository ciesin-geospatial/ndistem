    "- Cloud Data is stored on the internet so you can access it from anywhere.\n",
    "- Annual Global High-Resolution Extreme Heat Estimates (GEHE), 1983-2016 cloud data provides temperature data over time.\n",
    "- Native Land Digital API cloud data gives us spatial information about indigenous lands.\n",
    "- An Imagery Layer is like a map layer of images that show Earth’s features and changes, helpful in studying environmental patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cloud Data <br>\n",
    "**Cloud data** means that the data isn’t stored on your personal computer or phone, but instead, it’s stored on remote servers (essentially, other powerful computers) that you can access via the internet. Think of it like a virtual storage locker: instead of carrying all your books with you, you keep them in a locker that you can open from anywhere as long as you have a key (in this case, an internet connection). For example, **[NASA’s Earthdata Geographic Information System (EGIS)](https://gis.earthdata.nasa.gov/portal/home/)** is a resource for distributing cloud-native, GIS-ready NASA Earth Science data, services, and resources.\n",
    "\n",

    "**[Annual Global High-Resolution Extreme Heat Estimates (GEHE), 1983-2016](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/sedac-ciesin-sedac-sdei-gehe-1.00)** data set provides global 0.05 degrees (~5 km) gridded annual counts of the number of days where the maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGTmax) exceeded dangerous hot-humid heat thresholds for the period 1983 to 2016. Created by Tuholske, C., P. Peterson, C. Funk, and K. Caylor. Published by **[NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/sedac-daac)**. Version: 1.00.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Native Land Digital API <br>\n",
    "**[Native Land Digital API](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e46f229101f3438fbe123374e14f98f4)** is a resource developed to provide access to data on Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties worldwide. This API connects users to a wealth of information about Native lands and cultural heritage, gathered with the goal of increasing awareness and understanding of Indigenous territories and histories. By using the Native Land Digital API, educators, researchers, developers, and community members can easily access accurate maps and information about Indigenous Nations and their traditional territories. This tool allows users to explore how land and borders have been shaped by history, fostering a deeper appreciation for the diversity and resilience of Indigenous communities worldwide.\n",
