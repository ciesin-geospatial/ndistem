    "Script by Juan F Martinez and Geroge Verghese, CIESIN and SEDAC. Intro and code comments written by ChatGPT with edits by Juan F. Martinez. \n",

    "### This is a demo of the [Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL)](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL), part of the NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) Training initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo uses cloud data from NASA's [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/centers/sedac-daac) hosted in NASA’s Earthdata Geographic Information System (EGIS) Enterprise portal.    \n",
    "\n",

    "### What is cloud data?\n",
    "- Cloud Data is stored on the internet so you can access it from anywhere.\n",
    "- NASA EGIS cloud data gives us information about Earth from NASA’s satellites.\n",
    "- An Imagery Layer is like a map layer of images that show Earth’s features and changes, helpful in studying environmental patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cloud Data is not stored in your computer or phone, rather, it is stored in remote servers\n",
    "Cloud data means that the data isn’t stored on your personal computer or phone, but instead, it’s stored on remote servers (essentially, other powerful computers) that you can access via the internet. Think of it like a virtual storage locker: instead of carrying all your books with you, you keep them in a locker that you can open from anywhere as long as you have a key (in this case, an internet connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cloud Data from NASA EGIS\n",
    "**NASA’s EGIS (Earth Science GIS)** is a system where NASA stores data about Earth collected from satellites and other sources. The cloud data from NASA EGIS includes information about things like weather, land use, vegetation, water, and socioeconomic data. Because this data is stored in the cloud, researchers, scientists, and students worldwide can access and study it without having to store massive amounts of data on their personal devices. This data helps us learn about and monitor the Earth, like spotting environmental changes or natural events and learning how humans and the environments interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Imagery Layer\n",
    "An **imagery layer** is like a digital photograph of the Earth's surface taken from space. Satellites capture images of the Earth over time, which are then stored in layers that can be added to maps. Each layer might represent a different type of data, such as land cover (trees, water, cities), temperature, or weather patterns. By looking at these layers together, scientists can study changes and patterns on Earth over time. For example, an imagery layer from NASA might show how glaciers are shrinking or how forests are growing in certain areas."
